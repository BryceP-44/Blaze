# Blaze-AI
A self learning artificial intelligence. 

Every point is moved half the distance to the point that is closest to it.
I am working on adding multiple levels of inferencing. Record data and then apply it to this program to let the robot learn.
An easy example would be to record tilt angle on a bike with thrust. The program would correlate various thrusts for given angles.
Then, a robot could be put on the bike, read it's tilt angle, and see what thrust a human would normaly apply at that angle. 
I plan to work on this project more to make it user friendly and have any number of paramters (not just 3). Also, I hope to
try a new way to cluster data that would eliminate the cases where multiple levels of inferencing would even be needed (such as in the image below).
